<h1 align="center">🗑️👀 WasteWatcher</h1>

<h3 align="center">A smart YOLOv8-based system to detect garbage in public spaces 🚮</h3>

---

WasteWatcher is a computer vision prototype built using **YOLOv8**, **Streamlit**, and **Python** that detects garbage in public places through images — aiming to raise awareness and assist civic bodies.  

The issue it addresses is simple: **in India, a huge section of the public lacks basic civic sense**. Littering is common, and waste often goes unattended in streets and parks. This system automatically detects garbage and simulates alerts to authorities, promoting cleanliness and responsible behavior.
